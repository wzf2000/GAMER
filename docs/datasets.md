## Datasets

We provide some datasets in the `data/` directory. If you want to use your own datasets, please follow the data format below.

### Single-behavior recommendation datasets

For single-behavior recommendation datasets, it should contain at least the following files:
- `*/*.inter.json`: User-item interaction data in JSON format. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "0": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        "1": [2, 3, 4],
        // ...
    }
    ```
    where the keys are user IDs and the values are lists of item IDs that the user has interacted with, ordered by time.
- `*/*.item.json`: Item metadata in JSON format. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "1": {"title": "Item 1", "category": "A"},
        "2": {"title": "Item 2", "category": "B"},
        // ...
    }
    where the keys are item IDs and the values are dictionaries containing item metadata (e.g., title, category, etc.).
    If no metadata is available, you can use an empty dictionary for each item:
    {
        "1": {},
        "2": {},
        // ...
    }
    ```

### Multi-behavior recommendation datasets

For multi-behavior recommendation datasets, it should contain at least the following files:
- `*/*.MB.inter.json`: User-item interaction data in JSON format. It is the same as `*/*.inter.json` in single-behavior datasets, but it contains interactions of all behaviors.
- `*/*.MB.behavior.json`: Behavior types for the interaction sequence in JSON format. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "0": ["click", "cart", "buy", "click", "buy"],
        "1": ["click", "click", "cart"],
        // ...
    }
    ```
    where the keys are user IDs and the values are lists of behavior types corresponding to each interaction in the interaction sequence.
- `*/*.item.json`: Item metadata in JSON format. It is the same as `*/*.item.json` in single-behavior datasets.
- `*/*.behavior_level.json`: Behavior levels in JSON format. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "click": 0,
        "cart": 1,
        "buy": 2
    }
    ```
    where the keys are behavior types and the values are their corresponding levels. Higher level indicates stronger user preference.

### Session-wise multi-behavior recommendation datasets

For session-wise multi-behavior recommendation datasets, it should contain at least the following files:
- `*/*.SMB.inter.json`: User-item interaction data in JSON format. It is the same as `*/*.inter.json` in single-behavior datasets, but it contains interactions of all behaviors.
- `*/*.SMB.behavior.json`: Behavior types for the interaction sequence in JSON format. It is the same as `*/*.MB.behavior.json` in multi-behavior datasets.
- `*/*.SMB.session.json`: Session information for the interaction sequence in JSON format. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "0": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2],
        "1": [0, 0, 1],
        // ...
    }
    ```
    where the keys are user IDs and the values are lists of session IDs corresponding to each interaction in the interaction sequence.
- `*/*.SMB.time.json` (optional): Time for the interaction sequence in JSON format. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "0": ["2017-11-24 19:24:10", "2017-11-24 19:30:45", "2017-11-25 10:15:20", "2017-11-25 10:45:00", "2017-11-26 14:05:30"],
        "1": ["2017-12-01 09:10:00", "2017-12-01 09:20:15", "2017-12-02 11:30:45"],
        // ...
    }
    ```
    where the keys are user IDs and the values are lists of datetime corresponding to each interaction in the interaction sequence.
- `*/*.item.json`: Item metadata in JSON format. It is the same as `*/*.item.json` in single-behavior datasets.
- `*/*.behavior_level.json`: Behavior levels in JSON format. It is the same as `*/*.behavior_level.json` in multi-behavior datasets.

### Other files

For generative models, you may also need the following files:
- `*/*.index.json`: Item index mapping in JSON format. For example:
    ```json
    {
        "0": ["<a_0>", "<b_0>", "<c_0>", "<d_0>"],
        "1": ["<a_1>", "<b_1>", "<c_1>", "<d_1>"],
        // ...
    }
    ```
    where the keys are the original item IDs and the values are the mapped item tokens used in the model. This file is used for tokenization and detokenization of items.
- `*/*.index.**.json`: Additional item index mapping files in JSON format generated by different tokenizers. You can refer to the `SeqRec/tasks/tokenize.py` for more details.

We provide a toy dataset in `data/Toy`. You can refer to it for the data format.
